# SEAN-ZSH-ROOT

This is Sean's personal root directory
It assumes a zshell, 
and both sets up this shell and provides some useful executeables.

# Install

* Edit `ZDOTDIR` in `.zshenv` to point to zsh in this dir
* run `cp .zshenv ~/`
  * this adds an zsh environment file to your home repo which will point here
* run `ln -s [path here]/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
  * this creates a symbolicly linked `.vimrc` in your home dir that maps 
  to this vimrc
